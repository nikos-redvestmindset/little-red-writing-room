"What's the function of a Worm?" asked OchraMags. She was the junior instructor of the last surviving Sparky rebel colony in the Underground. Several kids raised their hands. Behind her at a distance, hanging by two thick cables from the ceiling of the giant terraformed tunnel, the big LED firefly screen read: 

"*Days since last Worm Attack: 732*". 

PurpleFrog tried to lift up her hoodie to avoid eye contact with OchraMags. But this bulky firefly rebel uniform resisted her every move. And she couldn't sit cross-legged in these fat nano-steel boots.

"TELL ME U MISS WALKIN BAREFOOT AND SILK KIMONOS OR I LL MAKE U SMELL THESE STUPID BOOTS ," she texted her brother through her standard-issued rebel "terminal". When he didn't respond she hid the terminal behind the metal crate and fired up an "anime" she'd discovered in the depths of the colony's data stash – a girl and her pet running in green fields of grass under mountains. Just like home. If only she could convince her brother to return Overground. Then she'd make a wish to the Archon Spirits to give her back her parents. And a pet dog. Why was *she* the sensible one? She was twelve. He was *sixteen*.

"Worms keep the Underground function," said OzzieHeron, the boy who had introduced himself to PurpleFrog on the day she and her brother were brought into the colony. Day 720\. He always sat next to her during class for some reason.

"Worms were made to zero us out," said a girl suspended in the air by her magnetic omni-directional rig – M.O.D.R. All the kids were allowed one. Except PurpleFrog and her brother. They had barely started their training.

"Worms are here to protect WormWood and his two-hundred-year-old lie of the Overground," said OchraMags and projected a hand-drawn centipede creature on the classroom screen from her terminal.

"The Overground *is* the real world. Not *this rabbit hole*," said PurpleFrog.

"Wrong, newb. You see a Worm, you worm your butt into a one-eighty and run genki double time. They can't be destroyed," said OchraMags.

PurpleFrog's terminal buzzed. An answer from her brother. The text crawled out into the screen a letter at a time: "I...AM...". Then her terminal screen turned red. The next moment, the firefly light strips across all pipes, tents, and sectors throughout the colony turned red. There were no sirens, no screams. Just deathly vibrating red silence. 

PurpleFrog picked up her terminal from its hiding place and started to shake it. 

"Hey you, how do I make this thing work?" she said to OzzieHeron. 

But his gaze was transfixed at the classroom screen along with everyone else's.

*"Alert: Worms at the gates. Evacuation Protocol Activated."*

Underneath the message was a recording of the colony's outer gate camera. When the video played PurpleFrog held her breath. She heard the other kids gasp too. The dark outline of a long cyber monstrosity that looked like the earlier sketch lifted its large body towards the camera and swiped at it with a claw. The camera signal never returned. It happened in less than a second. But before the signal disappeared PurpleFrog saw hundreds of needle-red glowing eyes looking back at her. The same eyes of the thing that took her parents away the day before Day 720\. Except that one had wings and could fly.

She clutched her mother's necklace inside her hoodie. *"Keep it safe\!"* her mother had said right before the metal monster had snatched her up into the sky. Her brother had stood there like an ice statue just staring at the thing. *"Run\!"* their mother had yelled and PurpleFrog had to kick her brother in the shins to get him into action, or he would have been next. Or her. Or both.

"How do I get this brick to work?\!" she yelled at OchraMags while banging her terminal on the metal grid. What if these things had come for her brother? What was he trying to say? "*I AM ...in danger? ...getting eaten?*" If he saw those glowing red eyes again...

She had to be there to kick him in the shins. Again. 

Her voice and banging echoed across the tunnel. 

"Sshhh, keep it quiet, newb\!\!" hissed OchraMags over the ordered, soft movement of boots and hand signaling of instructions across the tunnel. PurpleFrog saw rebels hovering on their MODRs peeling firefly strips, disconnecting server stacks, emptying the hydroponic sector, and relaying crates to the end of the tunnel in well-formed columns. The kids were strapping their MODRs on their backs and shooting off one after the other off the classroom platform.

"Hey man-lady. Give me your terminal. I need to text my brother." said PurpleFrog.

"Comms are off, newb. Only the central beacon is active so squads who are out can find us." 

"You mean this?" said PurpleFrog and pointed at the antenna of the Central Comms building. If that was the only thing that could send a message and she connected her terminal to it then she could message her brother. 

She scrambled down the metal ladder and started climbing off the platform. But OchraMags was on her. PurpleFrog pushed her away but the man-lady did not budge. She was built like a tree. OchraMags grabbed her by the hoodie and hauled her back onto the platform, pinning her in a steel grip.

"Let me go\!" yelled PurpleFrog.

"Keep it quiet\! This place will be crawling with Worms any minute now. SnowRaven is safe. His squad has done tons of runs outside. They know their stuff, OK? Follow my instructions. You'll see him later."

"I'd rather smell your hairy armpits," said PurpleFrog and dug her teeth into OchraMag's arm and bit hard. OchraMags screamed in pain and pulled away. PurpleFrog ran around the crates that served as desks to the opposite side of the platform.

"Ugh\! You osmic princess doll\!" OchraMags hissed. "You're coming with me even if I have to carry you out myself." 

She whipped a nanocarbon line from her toolbelt, turned it into a loop, and lunged after PurpleFrog's neck. But PurpleFrog dodged around a metal crate and kept far away. The ladder was a lost cause now. If only she could fly off the platform. And that's when she noticed OchraMags's MODR pack lying next to the classroom equipment. She ran for it and flung it around her back. It was bulkier than a sack of firewood. She stumbled and almost fell off the platform.

OchraMags skidded to a halt. She threw her hands up in surrender. "Stop," she breathed. "Don't do anything stupid, newb. I'll take you to your brother. I promise."

"Right. And I trust you as much as a silent fart," PurpleFrog said. She threaded her arms into the backpack's sleeves, just as she’d seen the other kids do. The MODR pack came to life. The fabric coiled around her limbs like a snake, as the internal gears hissed to life. Magnetic hooks snapped out from her wrists like talons. All she had to do was aim and fire.

"Don't do it, newb. I swear I'll leave you for the Worms," said OchraMags. 

PurpleFrog gripped her terminal and thrust her other hand toward a ceiling crate and wiggled her fingers like she'd seen the other kids do. But the line did not fire. "Shoot\!" she said. Nothing. The line stayed dead. OchraMags went after her, arms outstretched, the nanocarbon loop ready. PurpleFrog bolted, but the heavy pack made her knees buckle. She was losing ground fast. Why wasn't this rotten thing not firing? She frantically flexed her fingers in strange combinations. OchraMags was almost on top of her right when PurpleFrog extended her index and pinky fingers. She felt the sleeve around her arm recoil and then hiss like a viper. PurpleFrog flung herself into the empty air just as the hook shot upwards.

But her metal boot stumbled at the firefly strip covering the platform's rim and her hook paired off center. She spun sideways in a wild arc and slammed onto another crate, the loud bang echoing across the tunnel. She ended up dangling upside down, facing the concrete floor a couple of dozen feet below her. She lost grip of her terminal and it crashed into a million pieces. 

She clutched her mother's necklace with her free hand to keep it safe. In her panic, her other hand also clenched into a fist. The lock to her line hissed open and her body dropped into a freefall. Only feet from the floor, she threw her hand open, breaking the gesture. The line snapped taut, spinning her body upright just as her boots scraped against the concrete. A foot lower and her knees would have shattered, leaving her as bait for the Worms.

"You empty doll\! You wanna die? Then die. I got no time for this kilombo," said OchraMags from above and disappeared onto the platform to pack the classroom equipment.

"Works for me\!" said PurpleFrog.

Then she looked at the comms tower a few yards away. There were bound to be more terminals there.

–2–

PurpleFrog released the pairing of her MODR lines, and they retracted into their sleeves. The antenna was still attached to the roof. She traced the antenna cable snaking around the scavenged metal parts that were welded together to form the skeleton of the tower. The end of the cable disappeared into the tent that served as the comms room through the bottom of one of the attached panels. No one seemed to be inside the tent. The rebel groups were still busy clearing out the hydroponic sector since it was closer to the gates. But she figured not for long. She moved for the tent. She unpacked the MODR and entered the comms room. 

It was void. All the equipment was already packed in sealed crates. The tip of the antenna cable lay disconnected. Only one crate sat open. Strange. Someone had definitely been here after the Worm alert and they'd be back. Maybe that crate was meant for the antenna? She pushed the thought aside, cracked open a crate and rummaged inside until she found a terminal. She activated its energy crystal. The screen was all blue. She tried pairing it with the antenna cable. Nothing. She groaned and kicked the nearest crate. It toppled, spilling stuff across the floor. A thing that looked like an octopus caught her eye. She remembered hearing about these "routers" in class. She grabbed it and pressed one of its "legs" to the antenna cable. Click. Then pressed another "leg" to the terminal's crystal. Click. The terminal screen burst to life and the familiar circle of letters appeared. 

"Yes\!"

She touched her fingers to the circle and made the typing gestures for: "WHER R U"

She paced the room waiting for the reply. Restless, she opened the tent flap and glanced at the hydroponic section. The rebels were still there. Her chest relaxed a bit. She closed the flap and turned back to the terminal. Except it wasn't where she'd left it. It was sliding across the floor, getting dragged by the antenna cable towards the far side of the tent.  Before she could grab it, the terminal slid under the canvas wall. She did a one-eighty and bolted through the tent flaps and around the tent. By the time she got to the other side, the terminal was dangling in mid air, getting pulled higher and higher.

She stepped on the side for a better view of the tip of the comms tower and her stomach dropped like a stone. MyaxSerp had appeared up there. He was hanging by his MODR and was pulling the antenna cable as he tried to unwrap it from the tower structure. Of all people...why him? She remembered his dark eyes tracking her and her brother on Day 720, when the rescue squad had brought them in.  His father was one of the two rebels who had not returned. And on Day 721, when the recon squad brought back his father's body, MyaxSerp's eyes had gone wild. He threw himself at her brother and locked his arms around his neck in a chokehold. Her brother elbowed him again and again, but MyaxSerp wouldn't let go. Two adults had to pull them apart. Since then, they couldn't even be in the same line of sector together.

PurpleFrog wore her MODR pack and pulled her hoodie so tight, only her eyes were visible.

"Oi, Myax," she said in a made up adult voice.

MyaxSerp looked down. His eyes narrowed. He signaled something complex with his hands. PurpleFrog's hand signaling vocab was close to nil. During *that* class, she had instead watched an "anime" of muscular guys wearing masks wrestling with each other. She promised herself to not skip class ever again.

"I was put in charge of comms. Blame Mags. So, just head over to...you know...Sector 9," she said in a made-up adult voice.

MyaxSerp raised an eyebrow. He then noticed the dangling terminal at the end of the cable he was pulling.

"Curious," he said and tugged at the cable, testing its weight. Then took a long look at PurpleFrog. 

"Well, if it isn't the newb princess," he said this time without hand signals. 

"Ahem...head ASAP to Sector 9\. That's an order," said PurpleFrog.

"There is no Sector 9, you imp," MyaxSerp snapped. 

The terminal beeped and he paused. Then he grinned. He yanked the cable up even faster.

"Och. Pork my gas\!" PurpleFrog hissed out a breath. 

She fired a line from her MODR, aiming for the terminal. She missed. The line paired with MyaxSerp's boot instead. Close enough. She zipped upward, free hand outstretched for the terminal. MyaxSerp was jerked downward by the weight, nearly dragging down the whole antenna with him. He planted his feet on a metal panel for support and fired an extra line at the roof of the massive tunnel. It paired with a fat pipe. PurpleFrog was inches from the terminal, when he yanked it up and caught it. She grabbed empty space and ended up dangling underneath him.

"Give me that\!" she said.

He ignored her. He pulled the terminal to his face, read the message, and grinned.

"I'm a little newb princess. Hug me big handsome brother," he said in a fake baby voice.

PurpleFrog fired another line and this time her aim was dead on. It paired right next to MyaxSerp's. She rocketed upward and at the same time she retracted the line that was paired with his boot. He lost his balance but so did she and before she could unpair, she crashed into him and they both tumbled on top of the platform around the antenna. 

"Say goodbye," he said and she saw him pull a waveblade from his boot.

She didn't hesitate. She wrapped her legs around his neck in a choke, just like she'd seen in the anime. She grabbed the antenna for leverage and squeezed her legs. She saw the waveblade drop to the platform.

"What did my brother say?" PurpleFrog asked.

"That he's bait for the Worms," MyaxSerp said and she squeezed harder.

"You're lying\!" 

She heard noise inside the tent. The adults had arrived to pick up the crates. The crates she had just ransacked. She hoped...really really hoped they'd just re-pack and leave. 

"Oi, Myax, everything OK up there?" she heard an adult call out. 

MyaxSerp tried to reach for the waveblade but she squeezed harder and he stopped moving. She stretched an arm as far out as she could and gave a thumbs up while trying to keep her grip on MyaxSerp. She hoped "following protocol" meant no one would waste precious time on MyaxSerp's progress report. She turned to face him.

"Tik tok, Myax."

He tapped her leg. She lessened her squeeze.

"He said he is at the...," gasped MyaxSerp.

"Where??"

"You're choking me..." said Myax and she felt his body go limp.

PurpleFrog quickly unwrapped her legs from his neck. She regretted it the next moment. Myax rolled forward and grabbed the waveblade. PurpleFrog moved behind the cover of the antenna.

"Where is he??" she said.

MyaxSerp brought the waveblade closer. Its buzzing edge cut the silence. She could smell the sour air as the electricity ionized the tunnel dampness around the nanocarbon edge.

"Why was your brother – green and untrained – selected for a mission with all these Worms around? NetZero will take care of him real good. Make him a pretty worm bait."

PurpleFrog looked for any adults nearby but there was no one there. They must have moved all the crates already.

MyaxSerp licked his lips like a predator.

"Your brother will die. But you first."

He swung the waveblade. PurpleFrog jerked backward and the blade sliced through her line instead. She tried to hold on by her second line but saw in slow motion as MyaxSerp sliced it out from under his boot and she felt her body go on freefall. She screamed as she fell, then had the wind knocked out of her lungs when her back slammed on a metal panel. Then everything went pitch black.

Darker than the darkest corners of the Underground.

–3–

"*PurpleFrog\!*" said a voice in her mind. 

It sounded just like her brother but why was he using her ridiculous rebel name? Her name was Mauve. Mauve Cal. He knew that. She tried to snap back at him "*Chion Cal, you gas bubble, you had me worried*" but it's like she had no throat. Maybe it wasn't her brother. Wasn't her brother bait for the Worms? Or maybe they'd already caught him and now they had her too. And they would turn them both into dinner for WormWood. Whoever that guy was. Maybe he's not a guy. Maybe he was a giant Worm if the rebels were so afraid of him...

She felt her whole body begin to shake. "*Yep,*" she thought. "*The Worms definitely got me.*" Those ugly gas monsters had finally got her. They got her parents and her brother and now her. Anger replaced the fear inside her chest.

"PurpleFrog\!" said the voice again.

"What?\!" she snapped and opened her eyes.

She saw the OzzieHeron boy's face. What was *he* doing here? Wasn't he supposed to have escaped already? How long was she unconscious? And why was his face so close to her face?

"PurpleFrog, you're awake\! Can you move?"

She tried to get up but winced and fell back to the floor. He pulled out a blue capsule and placed it gently in her palm. Then offered her his hydration cellpack.

"Drink this. You'll feel better." 

"Is my brother bait for the Worms?" 

The OzzieHeron boy gave her a strange look.

"You're in shock. Drink the meds. The escape hatch will be sealed with lasers as soon as the last crate is in."

She needed the strength if she was going to figure out where her brother was so she swallowed the blue thingy with some water. She felt a cooling sensation travel from her stomach all the way to her muscles and bones. Her back pain softened and then disappeared altogether. She felt a rush of cool energy vibrate through her skin. She jumped to her feet and the MODR backpack felt lighter. Excellent.

"The Worms have broken through the second gate," said OzzieHeron and took her hand and pulled her with him. He was surprisingly strong for his size. She followed along as they jogged to the far end of the tunnel.

"Who is NetZero," she asked.

"He's the captain of the CyberDivers squad," he replied.

"What is he going to do with my brother?"

"Don't worry about your brother. NetZero is one of the best captains we got."

"Has anyone from his squad ever died before?"

"Every squad has lost people. It's dangerous outside the colony."

"Where is the squad now? Are they back?"

"Don't know. Before the comms went down I heard they were at the Big O in the Ruins before comms went down."

"Where is that?"

"It's in the Deep."

OzzieHeron grabbed her wrist tighter. She could see the opening to the escape tunnel. They were a dozen yards away. Only a few colonists remained outside with the final crates to push through the hatch. But everyone froze as a loud hiss at the other end of the tunnel was followed by a loud bang when the innermost security gate came crashing down. She saw the tunnel entrance fill out quickly with large dark metal shapes bathed in the red light of the gate alarms. Needle-point red dots scanned the space as if smelling the air around them. Smelling for prey. Then as of one mind the Worms propelled forward, their metal legs making a piercing shredding noise as they dug into the concrete floor a thousand times a second.

OzzieHeron tightened his grip and pulled her forward, away from the Worms, but she slapped his hand aside. 

"How do I get to the Ruins from here?" she asked.

"We have to go. NOW\!"

"I'm not moving until you tell me."

"Through the gates," he said. "Or ..." then he shut his mouth.

"Or??"

PurpleFrog grabbed OzzieHeron by the collar of his firefly hoodie and looked into his eyes. He blushed. His mouth was sealed but his gaze pointed upwards. She followed it and noticed the single air vent by the sanitation sector. She heard a loud bang behind her and turned to see just as the Worms cut through the last leg of the comms tower with their claws. The structure smashed to the ground. PurpleFrog was inside that tower less than a minute ago. Now it was a pile of sliced metal panels and tent flaps.

"We gotta go\!" he yelled.

She looked towards the escape tunnel. All the crates were inside. OchraMags was making furious hand signals. PurpleFrog didn't need to know the rebel sign language to guess the gesture for "Get your butts in here pronto\!"

PurpleFrog released OzzieHeron.

"Go\! I'm right behind you," she said.

As soon as he was a few yards ahead of her, she placed the waveblade she just stole from him inside her boot and she ran towards the sanitation sector in the opposite direction.

"See you on the other side\!" she yelled as she raised her right arm and fired a line. 

It paired with a ceiling pipe and she flew upwards. She was saving her left arm – the good one – for her next move. The critical one. The do-or-die-as-worm-bait move. To her left, a Worm skittered upside down across the ceiling heading towards her.  To her right, a second Worm changed its plan to attack the escape tunnel and zoomed upwards the tunnel wall. Its sharp legs did not miss a single step. How can these things crawl so fast on walls? What were their hideous legs made of? She hoped that OzzieHeron made it to the escape tunnel in time.

As soon as she reached close to the opening of the vent she made a fist and locked the line. She aimed with her left arm at the mouth of the vent. But it was not that simple. Her body was spinning slowly in the air, making her target extra annoying to hit. She did not have time for the world to stop spinning and she definitely did not have time to reload for a second shot. The Worms were seconds away. She took a deep breath, aimed, and fired. Click\! The line paired beautifully with the rim of the vent. 

She released the ceiling line at the same time she reeled the other line to bring herself to the vent. She thought the MODR zip her right into the vent, but gravity had other plans. The moment the ceiling line magnet let go, she plummeted. She fell so fast that she ended up hanging a few feet below the air vent. She felt the gears inside the MODR pack grind as the MODR struggled to adapt to the unexpected force. Both Worms shifted their bodies to match her new location and sped after her. He MODR groaned as its gears slowly lifted her towards the vent. 

"Crank faster you gassing garbagio\!" she yelled at the backpack. Grack-crunch it went...The worms closed in at ten feet. Grack-crunch...Five feet away. Grack...She waited no more. She threw her arms up and her fingers found the vent's edge. She pulled with all her strength. Right as she heard the Worm's claw snap at her feet she hauled herself inside. The claw smashed at the rim of the vent. She was in\!

"Ha\! You gassing sausage. Catch me now\!" she stuck her tongue out to the Worm. The Worm did not respond. The myriad red needle pins on its head scanned her face and then the tight vent space. Then the Worm disappeared.

\- 4 \-

But not for long. She heard rapid clicking underneath her. Was one of those things crawling upside down onto the vent? Suddenly the tip of a claw poked through the metal just a few feet in front of her. It sliced the vent like a waveblade carving shapes on a piece of paper. Slow and methodical. That gasser was going to cut the entire part of the vent that stuck outside the wall of the tunnel and drop her like garbaggio. She scrambled to reach the safety of the depths of the vent but her arm wouldn't move forward. In fact, as if by an invisible force, her arm was getting yanked backward – *out* of the vent. The line\! She'd forgotten to retract her MODR line after releasing it from the ceiling earlier. The other Worm must have caught it and was using it to fish her out. 

PurpleFrog reached for the waveblade in her boot with her free left arm, but just then – Crack – the vent tilted. The blade slipped from her boot and began to slide towards the edge. Without a waveblade she was defenseless. But every neuron in her brain told her she should be heading the *other* direction, *away* from the vent's mouth. She lunged for the blade. Her fingers closed around the handle just as it reached the edge and she sliced off the line just before she was dragged outside. She flipped around, firing her left arm's line deep into the vent, then gripping the line hard. The line retracted and she shot back inside right as the claw was about to finish cutting its circle. So she had an idea. She released the MODR line to stop sliding and finished cutting the circle with her own blade.

Crash\! The vent went down with the Worm underneath it. 

The Worms shrieked. She peered over the jagged edge of the vent. It was a total wreck. The two Worms were tangled up in her severed MODR line and the heavy metal vent. They looked like a giant bowl of angry noodles.

"Good luck untangling that mess, you gassers," PurpleFrog shouted.

She regretted it instantly. 

The third Worm, which was busy cutting through the escape hatch, stopped. It slowly spun its head around, locking onto her with its red needle-eyes. Then, it crawled up the wall after her.

"Oh, you think I'm an easier target? Let's see you fitting into this vent," she said. At least the rebels were safer now. If she got out of this alive, they should thank her for saving their sorry butts.

The Worm reached the vent in a heartbeat. It loomed over the opening, its eyes scanning her. She stuck her tongue out.

"Your friends tried. Look at them now," she taunted the Worm.

The Worm's response was a series of rapid-fire clicks. It sounded like a thousand bones snapping in tiny pieces. Then, she noticed something impossible. The red dots were shifting, crowding together. No. It wasn't just the dots moving. Its entire head was shrinking, the metal plates sliding and reassembling to make itself thinner. Was it transforming? For real? Was there anything these gassing things could *not* do??

Then the Worm's head squeezed through the opening.

"Are you gassing serious right now?" PurpleFrog gasped.

She scrambled deeper into the vent, faster than she ever had in her life. Behind her, a frenetic, metallic clicking and scraping filled the tunnel as the Worm forced its body into the narrow space. The whole vent shuddered and PurpleFrog could not tell if it was because of the Worm or her heart hammering at two hundred beats per minute. She crawled into the endless vent, turning left and right, her firefly suit illuminating only a few feet in front of her leaving the rest of the tunnel in front of her in pitch black shadow. If she was lost, she didn't care. As long as this thing did not find her. Waveblade or no waveblade, no one beat a Worm. She stole a glance over her shoulder and saw red lights reflecting on the metal. She stifled a scream and pushed hard, her hands and knees scraping the metal. 

"Please don't be a dead end, please don't be a dead end," she told herself.

The clanking grew louder. The red light reflecting on the metal vent intensified until the whole vent looked like a glowing blood red metal throat.

"I do not freeze. My brother is a freezer. I do not freeze..." she repeated to herself and clutched her mother's necklace.

That's when she saw it, illuminated by the eerie red glow. A small maintenance gap in the wall. She scrambled inside and found a cramped crawlspace, smaller than her bunkbed. A single large pipe ran through the center. It looked just wide enough for her—but surely too small for a Worm. Would it lead her down to the Deep? No time for guessing. She jammed the waveblade into the pipe's surface. It carved the metal like butter. She cut a round hole and then kicked the sliced part open with her boot. A cloud of steam blasted out, hitting her like a punch. The stench was that of nightmares: a trio of rotten eggs, sour vomit, and cow farts. She slammed a hand over her mouth, fighting the urge to add her own ingredients to the mix. 

"Of all pipes, it had to be the sewage?"

She was about to scramble back into the vent when the crawlspace flooded with red light. The Worm was right outside. She could sense it. She froze, turning into a statue. She squeezed her eyes, fighting the urge to cough from the stench that was all around her face. "*Maybe it'll keep going*", she hoped. The Worm crawled past the opening as cautious as a snail and the red light faded. If she took off back into the vent and out back to the colony would she make it? Before she could make up her mind a gurgling rumble shook the sewage pipe. A wave of sludge blasted through the pipe. Some of it shot through the hole and splashed across PurpleFrog's face. The foul liquid went straight into her nostrils.

"Agh\!" she cried, the word slipping out before she could stop it.

The sound of a thousand legs skittering inside the vent was followed by the red glow. In an instant the Worm was there. Its eyes fixated on her. Studying her. She felt the necklace on her chest getting warmer. The Worm made a rapid clicking sound that sounded like a metallic hiss and its eyes turned bloody redder. Was it angry at her necklace?? She raised her waveblade and glanced back at the hole in the sewage pipe.

"Oh, no. Absolutely not. I'd rather die than go in there. Get out of my way," she said out loud and waved the blade at the Worm. The Worm moved its head inside the space instead. 

"I officially hate this place\!" she cried and dove into the pipe.

But before she was all in, she felt herself getting yanked backwards by her MODR backpack. She did not hesitate. She sliced the straps with her blade and tumbled inside. She watched frozen as the Worm ripped the MODR apart. PurpleFrog decided that sewage waste smelled like lemon trees and roses. She dove deeper into the slimy insides of the pipe. Behind her, the pipe began to glow red. The Worm had widened the hole with its claws and was forcing its head inside. *Will this nightmare ever end?* Then, she heard a familiar roar: another load of waste was coming. She squeezed her mouth and nose and eyes and braced herself for the impact. 

Kaboom\! Zap\!

The load hit the Worm before it could retreat and she heard the crackle of electricity laced with the high-pitched mechanic shriek of the Worm. She wanted to cheer but the tsunami of nastiness slammed into her next. She found herself spinning and sliding like she was in a water slide from an Overground theme park, except this one was pitch back, filthy, and she wasn't expecting to see a gift shop with cute stuffed animals at the exit.

If this pipe didn't end soon she would suffocate either from the nasty smell or from choking herself to death. She vowed no matter what to not open her mouth even if she fainted. Were all these twists and turns placed there on purpose by some evil builder to force her to open her mouth? Her cheeks felt like they would blow up and she squeezed her lips harder. And then without warning, she went into a free fall. The pipe had ended, dropping her straight into a massive sewage pool sixty feet below. It was the world's most gigantic toilet hole. 

Splash\!

She fought the sludgy water, kicking until her head finally broke the surface. She gasped in a lungful of air and let out a scream that echoed off the walls.

"I hate this gassing place\!"

\- 5 \-

PurpleFrog swam out of the lake. Four tunnels branched out of the lake in different directions.

"Brother\! Are you there?" she shouted into the first. Her voice echoed back hollow. She tried the other tunnels. No response. But one of the tunnels sounded different. The sound didn't bounce back. She went into it and noticed she could see more details like the wet floor and the tiny pipes at the ceiling. If he was anywhere nearby she "knew" he'd go towards the brighter light. Unless the Worms had snatched him. Or maybe the pipes had dumped her miles away from where his squad had come. No one knew how far the Deep stretched. She shook the dark thoughts away, gripped her waveblade and jogged towards the beckoning glow. She burst out the other end and tripped on something. She looked at her feet and saw a bent metal slab, the letters half-scraped away. 

 MADISON AV

Then she looked up. 

Her breath caught in her throat.

An endless forest of brick, metal, and cement structures rose in the distance, so massive, so high that they seem to vanish in the darkness above. Jagged high ruins, pierced by hundreds of pipes and swarming with ant-like machines picking them clean in a ritualistic fashion. She followed the tallest towers toward a source of light so immense it didn't seem real. Was it the moon?

"Whoa\!" she cried.

She wasn't looking at the moon\! 

She was looking at the ceiling of a monstrous mega-tunnel—an underground world—and the moon was a colossal vent pouring bright from the world above. Was this it? The "Big O"? 

"They used to call them cities," she heard a voice behind her. "They called this one New York".

She spun, her waveblade held ready, but she put it away at the sight of her brother.

"Chion\!" she cried and ran into him.

"Hey, sis. I'd ask how you've been but..." he wrinkled his nose. "When was the last time you took a shower?"

She kicked him in the shin.

"Yeah, well, now you smell too."

"You shouldn't have come here," he said.

"Someone had to save your sorry butt from the Worms."

He sighed. "I had to tell my squad to move on without me after we heard about your little 'protocol incident'. We'll both be on bathroom cleaning duty for a week."

"No, we're not," she said.

"Oh? You'll sweet talk your way out of OchraMags?"

"No." She pointed upwards. "Because we're climbing through that big hole up there and going back home\!"

"Come. You should get washed first.  For everyone's health—biological and mental."

He headed towards the pipes, inspected them, and then pulled out his waveblade and sliced one open. Fresh water came running through and he started washing. 

"And then we finally go home," she said, stepping towards the makeshift water spring.

"Yes, we'll reunite with the rebels."

"No. *Home, home*. Overground. I hate this gassing place and these rebels. And they clearly don't want nothing to do with me. Win-win."

"The Overground is an illusion. When I went out with the squad today, we walked to the top of one of these *skyscrapers* and then followed the pipes outside. They lead to Mount Berachus."

He pointed up at the pipes that climbed like steel veins up through the Big O. 

"The mountain is hollow. It's a massive transport machine. Anything we ever wished for didn't "magically" appear because of the Archon Spirits. WormWood pumps everything from up here. He built the Underground to feed the Overground. You should read the server logs. It's all in there."

"Great," she said. "Since you know the way, what are we waiting for?"

"I was a coward, Mauve. I couldn't help Mother. I'm not making that mistake again. I want to fight back. With the rebels. You and I are going to fight. We must."

"Are you nuts? I've seen Worms up to my nostrils today." She pulled off her hoodie and splashed water over her face and neck. "If these things are hunting rebels, trust me, we're better off Overground. I may even agree to take a few of them with us. Not OchraMags or MyaxSerp. But OzzieHeron? I like his style."

She looked him straight in the eye.

"Come on. We know the Overground. Neat and easy."

SnowRaven didn't answer. 

His gaze had dropped. To the necklace. It hung uncovered now, glinting against her chest.

"The Worms are not hunting the rebels," he said slowly. "They are hunting that\! It all makes sense now."

"Yeah, well. Maybe. Maybe not," PurpleFrog said and took a step back.

"It must matter to WormWood. Maybe the rebels will know what to do with it."

"Not a chance. I'm not handing Mom's necklace to them. Not in a million years. Mom told me to keep it safe," said PurpleFrog and took another step away from him.

"We should take it to the rebels." 

He took a step forward and reached for it. 

She kicked him in the shin and bolted. 

He chased after her. She skidded down a dirt slope and into the city ruins. A rusted metal sign dangled from a pole. 

FIFTH AVE 

She sprinted towards the "skyscraper" with the needle at the top directly beneath the Big O. The road was cracked as if a giant hammer had smashed it apart. Chunks were either gone or sticking out like broken teeth. She leaped over a crashed stone lion lying in front of a grand building collapsed into itself. The letters above the entrance read 

...YORK PUBLIC LIB...

She cut right and slipped inside. The space was enormous. Dust coated everything in century-thick layers. Collapsed desks and bookshelves formed jagged heaps among stones and ancient machines with cables sticking out of them like dead vines.

She ducked behind a pile of rubble. 

She heard her brother's footsteps and held the necklace tight. It felt warm and...purple. Was it really glowing or were her eyes playing tricks?

"What if this whole war is about the thing around your neck?" she heard her brother say.

"Then Mom was right. We have to protect it." She crouched low and moved deeper into the shadows.

"The longer we keep it, the more danger we put everyone in. Maybe we should destroy it."

She felt the necklace get warmer in her hand. And brighter. It started to pulse. Slow. Heavy. Like a heart waking from a long nap.

"Hey you," she whispered to the necklace. "Are you trying to tell me something?"

"Come on, Mauve. You know I'm right." 

Her brother sounded closer. She crept deeper into the shadows. 

"No. Mom didn't destroy it. Mom, didn't give it to the rebels. If it was that simple, why didn't she?"

No answer. 

The pulse of the necklace quickened. Its light brighter. She tried to creep deeper into the shadows but her brother stepped into her path. He grabbed the chain around her neck. And she grabbed the purple stone of the necklace with both hands. Dust rose into the air as they struggled. Their boots scraped hard against the stone floor. She felt it shudder underneath her. 

"If you're wrong," he said through clenched teeth, "the last colony of the rebels will get wiped out. Can you live with that?"

"We are taking it with us Overground\!"

The necklace pulsed harder and stronger with an almost blinding light. 

Crack.

The stone gave way beneath their feet. With a scream she plummeted into the dark. She landed hard, and heard the sound of bones cracking as she hit the ground. She heard her brother drop next to her.

"Per...fect," she coughed, brushing dust off her face. "All I do is fall into gassing holes all day..."

But nothing felt broken. Amazing. But how? Then she opened her eyes and saw the answer in front of her. She was lying in a chair. On top of a skeleton. A human skeleton. And its skull was looking straight at her. PurpleFrog shrieked, her hands flying up in a blind reflex. She tumbled off the chair and dropped the necklace to the floor. It rolled to a stop next to her brother. He picked it up. But instead of pocketing it, he held it in front of him, like a lamp. The room glowed purple.

"That's unusual..." he said. He was staring at the skull. 

PurpleFrog looked from him to the skull and back at him. Then back at the skull. It had one eyeball still lodged in its socket. And it was vibrating with light. Not purple. Gold. 

Her brother reached and plucked the eyeball out of the skull.

"You're disgusting," she said.

"It's not an eye." He turned it between his fingers. "A real eye would've disintegrated centuries ago. See this? A connection port. Like a terminal's comms module. If we just ..."

Before he could finish, PurpleFrog yanked the terminal from his belt, snapped out the comms module and stuck the eyeball in its place. 

The terminal rebooted. A single message appeared:

*L.Y.R.A. protocol activated. Scanning for active clients across the Epochs...*

Then seconds later, a list of connections filled the screen, each with a location, a name, and a long string of numbers.

"That's impossible," said her brother.

"What is?"

He pointed. "These numbers. They're log timestamps. That code –*1278246600 –* that's 236 years ago. What could this mean? We..."

She didn't wait for him to finish. She tapped on a name.

"Will you stop?\!" he snapped. "You could be signaling the Worms\!"

*Establishing connection...*

The terminal beeped. The sound echoed in the silence. A message appeared on the screen.

*Hello? Who's this?*

They both gasped. PurpleFrog typed back fast.

*PurpleFrog. What's your rebel codename?*

The reply was instant.

*If this is a prank, I will report you to the library staff.*

Her brother picked up the terminal.

*The New York Public Library?* he typed.

*Obviously. How else would I be on a library PC?*

PurpleFrog reached for the screen to tell this someone they were clearly whacked in the head, but her brother caught her wrist.

"You know what this means, don't you?" her brother said. 

He grabbed her hoodie and shook her, grinning like an idiot.

"That the server logs finally fried your brain?"

"PC means Personal Computer. The extinct technology among the rubble upstairs. Humanity used it before the surface was buried under the WormWood Dome and then turned into the Underground."

She blinked. "Wait. You're not joking."

"You want a joke? Knock, knock."

"No."

"Too late. SnowRaven and PurpleFrog."

She groaned. "SnowRaven and PurpleFrog who?"

"The time travelers who jumped to a space-time point before WormWood built the Worms. And how did they do it? With the Ytterbium Entangler. The mythic artifact the rebels have been searching for centuries."

They both stared at the eyeball device, as if it might blink back. Her face lit up at the same time her mother's necklace pulsed in excitement. 

"So we can stop WormWood from ever creating these gassing Worms\!" she said. "Free and clear. It'll take a week, tops\!"

"I don't know about a week...," he scoffed. "We have to dig up the clues. In the Underground. Which was the real world back then. The Overground didn't exist."

She paused.

"So I was right all along\!"

 Then she kicked him in the shin.

"That's for being a major donkey\!"

"I'm sorry. But still..."

"I know," she said and took the necklace and gently placed it around the skeleton's neck.

"I'll be back for you soon," she whispered to the necklace. 

Her brother nodded in approval. Then she kicked him again.

"Ow\!"

"What are you waiting for?" she said. "Let's go find the rebels, dummy."
