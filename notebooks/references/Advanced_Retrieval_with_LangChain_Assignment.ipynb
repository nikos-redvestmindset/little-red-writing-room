    "- Understand and implement multiple retrieval strategies for RAG\n",
    "- Compare naive, BM25, multi-query, parent-document, contextual compression, ensemble, and semantic chunking approaches\n",
    "- Build RAG chains over a health and wellness knowledge base using LangChain and QDrant\n",

    "- Naive Retrieval\n",
    "- Best-Matching 25 (BM25)\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical user questions are vague or short. So they \"hide\" a bunch of the context or make it implicit. By reformulating a query into multiple variants we can highlight certain parts of the query that are not stated out explicitly. The reformulation adds detail to the query and extra information that it thinks it's relevant. So when we do the actual retrieval our query's embedding is more \"precise\" so if we use a similarity metric to find relevant chunks we can come \"closer\" to more chunks that way, thus increasing recall. One way to think about it is that instead of throwing a blunt object at the center of a tank to catch a specific type of fish, we instead shoot multiple precise arrows in targetted spots in the tank. We will catch more fish of the type we want and less fish that are \"collateral\". "

    "### ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "With short and highly repetitive sentences we will have similarity scores that are close to each other. A `percentage` threshold will become very sensitive to the variation. Imagine all our values are between 0.88 and 0.90 similarity scores. To pick the default 95-percentile would mean a value of around 0.899 or something similar but then it will depend on the distribution of the values. If most values are close to the 0.899 then we would have very few chunks. If they are below 0.899 we will have too many chunks. Standard Deviation will also have a similar problem and `interquartile` as well since those are designed to detect outliers. One interesting approach is to leverage `gradient` since that looks at the derivate (the difference between similarities) and this gives us more variability because it eliminates the absolute magnitude of the similarity value (in our case that 0.88 goes away) so we are looking at numbers such as 0.01 and 0.02, etc. With the right threshold value there we could split between a 0.01 and 0.02. The problem is that we can't guess a priori whether a good gradient value is 0.5 or 0.015. They are very different. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach would be to normalize the gradients and bring them into the [0,1] range in which case we can split on the 50% mark, but that means we'd need to modify the `SemanticChunker` source code to add a new threshold type called something like `gradient_normalized`. Another approach without modifying the implementation of `SemanticChunker` would be to use `gradient` and set an `expected_number_of_chunks` value. Then do a binary search on the actual threshold value until we come close to the expected number of docs. For example if the value of the gradient that splits our content into 10 chunks is 0.015 we would do a binary search starting with 0.5 and then searching \"downwards\" to 0.25 -> 0.125 ->... (using O(log) trials)."
